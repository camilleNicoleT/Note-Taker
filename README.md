## Description
For this Note Taker app project I took a simple front end without the ability to save or delete notes and upgraded it with an Express.js backend.

## Usage
- Note Taker is an easy to use app that allows you to create notes, save them, edit and delete them on a server.

- When you start to type in the note information a save button appears.
